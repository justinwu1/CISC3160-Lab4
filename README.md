In the C+++ Folder:
- I wrote a bubble sort in C++. I choice to use C++ because I want to see how the syntax of writing bubble sort would be different compares to other language. The main difference is that C++ needs to import a standard library to use functions like cout. Also, we need to have using namespace std to differentiate the same functio name in different libraries. Lastly, a pointer is used in the swap function because when C++ swap, it needs to know where the address is.

In the Python Folder:
- I wrote a bubble sort in Python, everyone says how simple the syntax is in python. Therefore, I decided to try python syntax and implement a bubble sort. It's indeed much shorter and simple syntax compares to C++. First, I didn't need to use import standard libraries, everything in built-in. Second, the for loop is shorter, there is a for x in range syntax. Third, brackets and semicolon isn't used in python, it's unnesscary to use them.
